  - Individual phase validation (Phase 1, 2, 3)
  - Complete character validation
  - Partial character development scenarios
  - Character role-specific tests (complete, incomplete, antagonist)
  - Relationship consistency validation
  - Mythology integration checks
  - Power/limitation balance assessment
  - Faction alignment verification
  - Story arc progression logic
  - Thematic coherence validation
  - Resource balance testing
  - Cross-realm consistency

- ✅ **Validation Rules** - 7 core validation rules:
  - Minimum relationships required: 3
  - Minimum abilities required: 2
  - Minimum conflicts required: 1
  - Limitation-to-power ratio: 0.7
  - All three phases must be present for completion

### 4. Documentation & Licensing
- ✅ **README.md** - User-facing documentation
  - Installation instructions

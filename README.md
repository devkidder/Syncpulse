## 🗺️ Roadmap Snapshot (Existing + Planned)

### Existing (v1.0.4)
- ✅ 11 published `@h4shed/*` packages (core + CLI + 9 skills)
- ✅ npm workspace publishing pipeline active on `main` and tags
- ✅ Security baseline hardened (0 known vulnerabilities at last audit)

### Planned (next release cycle)
- 🔄 Promote release checklist automation from docs into CI validation gates
- 🔄 Expand deployment verification for npm + GitHub release parity
- 🔄 Add richer release announcement templates for community launch posts
- 🔄 Merge and publish `daily-review` with release-quality docs and examples (PR #51 target)
- 🔄 Publish and harden `agentic-flow-devkit` with tests + release workflow verification
- 🔄 Implement tool logic + tests for `project-status-tool` and `project-manager`
- 🔄 Formalize planned-tool milestones into trackable issue groups for weekly triage

### Current blockers to watch
- GitHub PR/status triage currently depends on repository API/CLI availability in the execution environment.
- Scope configuration (`NPM_SCOPE`) must be set in GitHub Actions variables for organization-owned publishing.
- Without GitHub CLI/API credentials in the runtime, PR #51 check-run and deployment state must be confirmed directly in GitHub UI.

### Top 3 priorities now
1. Ship missing high-impact skills (`mermaid-terminal`, `ux-journeymapper`, `svg-generator`).
2. Add automated docs/package consistency checks for published scope metadata.
3. Track deployment/test status per release PR in a single release checklist.
4. Keep Actions test matrix pinned to active LTS lanes (20.x, 22.x) to avoid Node-version runtime drift.

## 🚢 Release Automation

- **npm publish workflow:** `.github/workflows/publish.yml`
  - Runs lint, typecheck, build, scope preparation, and workspace publish.
- **GitHub release workflow:** `.github/workflows/github-release.yml`
  - Runs on the same release tags (`v*`, `skill-*`) and creates GitHub Releases with generated notes.
- This split keeps npm publishing and release-note generation independently observable and easier to retry.
